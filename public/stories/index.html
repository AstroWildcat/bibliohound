                                        with her small town community. Instead, she gets far more than what
                                        she hoped for when she falls for the local church's mysterious, ewe parish
                                        associate.
                                        The two women enter a secret, tumultous relationship, and soon they both must
                                        answer the haunting question: will they give into their repressed, darker
                                        desires - or will they heal from the tragedies that have defined their lives?

                                    <p>Conrad has it all as the ideal American man, but deep down, he is forever haunted
                                        by childhood trauma and the horrors of a war he fought in. Unable to handle the
                                        disappointing banalities of his middle-class life, he soon spirals into a hidden
                                        life of violence, infidelity, and self-destruction. Yet day by day, the
                                        increasing pressures of his self-imposed guilt, violent self-loathing, and the
                                        impending weight of the consequences of his actions become harder to ignore.
                                        Soon, he must confront the ultimate question: Can he escape the cycle of
                                        destruction, or is his fate already sealed?

                                        in a conservative small town, she found solace in the digital world, where her

                                        connection in a world that often feels alien.</p>
