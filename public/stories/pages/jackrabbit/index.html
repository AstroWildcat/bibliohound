                            flood of letters begging him to come back to the reservation, and the strong yearning to not
                            rest until he makes a name for himself in the mainstream world of American literature with
                            his poetry, his heart is being pulled in many directions.</p>

                                    <p>A quiet yet nervous wreck of a man, he tends to liken himself to the jackrabbits
                                        who dwell in the Arizona desert. Underneath his surface-level irateness lies a
                                        sensitive and emotional man, one who is not afraid to cry as well pour his heart
                                        out into his writing.</p>

                        <p>"Why did you leave, Hikwsu? We were close to escaping it all for good, and you just up and
                            left one day. You didn't say anything. No goodbyes, nothing. You just left me to rot at that
                            school."</p>
                        <p>He did not look up at his sister. He kept his gaze locked behind her at the wall of
                            butterflies in her room, their little bodies pinned to the white paper background, enclosed
                            behind glass and wooden frames.</p>
                        <p>"I wanted to prove myself. Prove I was capable as any man in this country."</p>
                        <p>"Prove what? Prove yourself to the White Man? The White Man you so desperately idolize? The
                            White Man which will <i>never</i> see you as their equal? No, Hikwsu, you've only proven
                            you're a coward."</p>
                        <p>Stunned into silence, Frederick could only squeak out, "That's not true."</p>
                        <p>"It is, though. You just don't see it yet. But you will one day, and you will completely
                            regret what you've done."</p>

                        <h4>Meta Analysis</h4>
                        <p>This story was a long time coming. I've had a special interest in WWI since I saw 1917 in
                            2019, so writing a WWI-centric story was sort of invetiable.</p>
                        <p>As with most of my stories, the idea stemmed from me fleshing out a character. In Frederick's
                            case, I developed him for a WWI/WWII OC server I was in at the time so I could interact with
                            other people. However, doing research for his backstory and looking into the history of
                            Indigenous Americans in the military during this time period caught my attention more. My
                            desire to tell this fictional man's story is also rooted in my interest in the history of
                            the military service of non-white men. (This is something I am particularly interested in
                            with thanks to my grandfather's service.)</p>
                        <p>To this day, I'm still struggling to make the story as accurate and sensitive as possible
                            within my limits. It's been an intersting challenge so far.</p>
