                        <p>After the unexpected death of her husband in 1952, Judith Mitchell decides to get involved
                            with her
                            local church in the small, Midwestern town of Edenheim. However, she ends up becoming
                            acquainted with the alluring and hauntingly familiar Lillian, the parish's associate. The
                            two women end up in a complicated, secret relationship, one that only serves to grow in
                            intensity as time passes. With Judith's increasing hunger pains and delusions, there is only
                            one question: will she give into her instincts?</p>

                        <h2>Meta Analysis</h2>
                        <p>To be honest, I don't have a lot to say about this one. It's partially inspired by my sudden
                            and impending obsession with toxic yuri and Catholicism. I think both of those things are
                            pretty interesting. It also serves as a replacement for an older story, Erotomanie, which I
                            could never figure out how to plot properly. This story, on the other hand, has at least a
                            few route endings for the visual novel release. So hopefully this story ends up as some sort
                            of final product.</p>
