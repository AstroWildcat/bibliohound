                        <p>While I have a lot of social media accounts, most of them are inactive thanks to my fickle
                            attention span with most websites. The ones linked below are the accounts I tend to
                            prioritize.</p>

                                <h3>Goodreads</h3>
                            </a></p>
                        <p>A place for me to update my reading list. I personally prefer Storygraph, but alas, Goodreads
                            is what everyone uses to keep track of their reading progress. So as someone who wants to read, I have no real choice
                            in the matter.</p>

                        <p>This website has single-handedly given me motivation to work on watching movies again. I'm
                            serious. It challenges me to have something to say about a movie once I watch, and to
                            analyze it on a five star scale.</p>

                        <p>My preferred place to update my reading progress. That being said, I am still a really slow
                            reader, and it's kind of embarassing at this point. I also like the UI better, it's less
                            cluttered.</p>

                        <p>I never expected myself to be a fan of organizing images but here we are. Anyways, I'm usually on here to make aesthetic boards for my characcters and stories.</p>

                        <p>I've been using Tumblr since 2015, and that's not going to change anytime soon. If you want
                            to reach out to me privately, your best bet is to message me here.</p>

                        <p>I tend to blog about my characters, as I am rather fixated on them. That being said, the most I do on there is tag them in posts I think fit them. Sometimes I post art and musings about them as well.</p>

                        <p>This is where I keep all of my actual writing and prose. There's not much on it so far, because I haven't made a lot of short stories I feel are actually worth publishing.</p>
