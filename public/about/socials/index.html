                        <p>While I have a lot of social media accounts, most of them are inactive thanks to my fickle

                        <p>When Tumblr dies, this is what I will be using as my main social media. Besides a few other
                            spots on the internet. I still need to be searching around for that, actually.</p>

                        <p>Shoutout to this website for helping me through tough times with homebrewing my video game
                            consoles. I started using their forums recently, so while I haven't had any luck yet with
                            getting help with my current projects with homebrewing yet, that will hopefully change once
                            I learn to speak their lingo and learn more technical terms used in the homebrewing scene.

                        <p>A place for me to update my reading list. I personally prefer Storygraph, but alas, Goodreads
                            is what everyone uses to keep track of their reading progress. So as someone who wants to read, I have no real choice
                            in the matter.</p>

                        <p>This website has single-handedly given me motivation to work on watching movies again. I'm
                            serious. It challenges me to have something to say about a movie once I watch, and to
                            analyze it on a five star scale.</p>

                        <p>I have underappreciated forum culture for a long time, but I think this place will help me
                            appreciate it again. Everything about it is right up my alley so far.</p>

                        <p>My preferred place to update my reading progress. That being said, I am still a really slow
                            reader, and it's kind of embarassing at this point. I also like the UI better, it's less
                            cluttered.</p>
