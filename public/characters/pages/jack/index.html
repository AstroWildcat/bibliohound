                        <p>Many people see Jack as nothing more as the effeminately weak and pathetic, yet kind and
                            passionate preacher who always knows where to lead the congregation every Sunday.</p>
                        <p>While he is intuitive and likes to see the bigger picture, he is also empathetic towards the
                            less fortunate. That being said, he is not free from the vices of his self-percieved sins
                            and as much as he tries to not give in, he always does at the end of the day. Regardless, he
                            is focused on his repuatation and appearances in his community. There are times where he is
                            overdramatic and manipulative, and these overblown antics of his often leak into his speech
                            mannerisms and his actions during church.</p>
                        <p>He was raised in a small town Southern California. It was almost a ghost town, by all means,
                            not even marked on the map. As an adult, he was driven out by the boom in activity when oil
                            was discovered nearby, digusted by the state of its citizens and the money-hungry newcomers
                            that were drawn to his home. He train hopped his way to Oakland, driven away by the crime of
                            Los Angeles and the expensive cost of living in San Francisco. He was somehow able to land a
                            job at a local church. For a while, he did his job as expected, preaching to the ignorant
                            masses who attended about returning to God's graces again.</p>
                        <p>When he realized one of his flock, <a
                                href="https://bibliohound.neocities.org/characters/pages/mildred/">Mildred</a>, was
                            pining after him, he was unsure on how to react at first. Much as he tried his best to not
                            give into her feelings, he could not resist her company, and gave in. Soon, he and his
                            newfound girlfriend started to save money to move out of state.</p>
                        <p>After acquiring an ample amount of savings and a beat up car, he and his girlfriend managed
                            to move up to the state of Washington. They bought a small property in the costal area of
                            the state and had a little wedding ceremony with friends.</p>
