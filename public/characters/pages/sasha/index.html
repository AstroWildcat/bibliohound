                        <p>Sasha is the embodiment of a femcel.</p>
                        <p>She is a history major in a small college in Northeastern America. She plans to become a
                            historian who specializes in the history of medicine.</p>
                        <p>Many people on campus tend to avoid Sasha due to her reclusive nature, antisocial tendencies,
                            strong fixations on topics considered depraved, sadistic and unusual, and - the biggest
                            factor of them all - her tendency to reek as a result of going days without showering.</p>
                        <p>As a result, she tends to spend a lot of time online, far more than the average person. Her
                            usual haunts include true crime forums, history forums, and Tumblr. Her favorite online
                            activities include trolling and doing historical research on whatever topics interest her at
                            the moment.</p>
                        <h3>Trivia</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>She considers herself to be a Marxist-Leninist, and looks down upon all other political
                                positions that are not some variety of communism. She especially despises neoliberals
                                and fascists. That being said, she still has her issues with various branches of
                                communism that she is not fond of. In fact, she is prone to engaging in leftist
                                infighting on Tumblr. (A habit she is trying to break.)</li>
                            <li>Her favorite communist regimes to study are Eastern Germany and the Soviet Union - even
                                though she considers other people having any interest in the latter to be too
                                conventional and surface-level of a thing to do. She is very knowledgeable about the
                                history of the Ministerium f√ºr Staatssicherheit.</li>
                            <li>Her favorite metal band is Sabaton. Her preferred subgenres of metal are thrash metal,
                                progressive metal, and power metal. She has a history of doxxing NSBM fans, especially
                                those who are into Varg Vikernes.</li>
