                        <p>Many people consider Mildred - affectionately known as "Millie" - to be the reserved and
                            analytical type, at least on the surface.</p>
                        <p>She is a highly guarded and independent woman. Her strong sense of responsiblity and
                            attention to detail has made her an ideal wife in the eyes of many, though her neuroticism,
                            anger issues, and crass nature just as quickly drive them off.</p>
                        <p>She was born and raised in the city of Oakland, California. Under the thumb of a cold but
                            ultimately well-meaning mother and a father who was often busy with work, she grew up with
                            no company aside from her books and her annoying sister.</p>
                        <p>One day, she made the decision of going back to church in an attempt to appease her mother
                            again, only to meet the extremely effeminate but dashing preacher leading the congregation,
                            <a href="https://bibliohound.neocities.org/characters/pages/jack/">Jack Abbey</a>. For
                            months, she desperately pined after the oblivious man. Once he caught on, the two entered a
                            passionate, secret relationship. While interspecies relationships were technically legal in
                            the area, that doesn't mean they were looked upon fondly. The fact that it also doubled as
                            an interracial relationship, which was illegal, made it the sealing factor to keep the
                            relationship a secret.
                        </p>
                        <p>As their relationship progressed, Jack learned to relax and not hold himself up to such holy
                            standards all the time and allow himself to be imperfect. Meanwhile, Millie leanred to how
                            to fit into the constraints of society better, which had punished her for so long for
                            existing.</p>
                        <p>Becoming more and more fearful of being caught together, the two made plans to escape
                            California. Soon, the two were able to run away to Washington with nothing but their savings
                            and a beat up car. They managed to buy a property in the costal area of the state and got
                            married.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Despite being legally classified as an African Wild Dog on her paperwork, she has enough
                                fox ancestry in her bloodline to be mistaken for an African Wild Dog/Fox mix.</li>
